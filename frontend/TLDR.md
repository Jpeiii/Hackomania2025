# Extra Notes


> [!NOTE]
> The landing page only supports browsers. However, since the entire solution is built using React Native, it's easier to use the same tech stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> 1. Project Requirements

> Due to varying requirements for the project, we are using Firebase as the backend service, Redux-Saga for state management, and other technologies. However, the project also involves using local MongoDB databases, SQL, and Docker.

> 2. Proposed Session Plan

> I will guide you through setting up our Nomad App. After that, I will teach you how to set up everything from scratch for your development work on the assignment. Moving forward, we will regularly integrate the UI/UX and functionality you develop—such as the AI chatbot—into our solution, using Firebase and Redux-Saga.


> [!WARNING]
> This is the correct setup for a React Native project from scratch, and this is what the professor will teach throughout the entire course.
