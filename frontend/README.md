>
> We bridge the gap between travelers and travel agencies. Traditional travel planning often involves multiple agencies (local and destination-based), increasing costs and complexity. Our platform streamlines the > process, offering travelers a single point of contact and eliminating unnecessary expenses. By focusing on high-end travelers, we provide a premium experience without the hassle of multiple intermediaries.

> ## What we are doing?
>
> Our app supports iOS, Android, and web browsers. It's a social and booking platform dedicated to premium travelers, connecting them with luxury travel agencies offering customized experiences.

> [!NOTE]
> For our consumer-facing solution, which is a social media platform that simplifies trip booking and travel planning, we support iOS, Android, and web browsers
